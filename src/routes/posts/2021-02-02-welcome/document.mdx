## Conditionally rendering can be not very dry

A common pattern I have seen show up multiple times is the need to render components differently based on predicates and state.

In this example, we have the following functions that render cats, dogs, and birds.

```jsx
const renderBirds = (petName) => {
  return <h1>Bird: ${petName}</h1>;
};

const renderCats = (petName) => {
  return <h2>Cat: ${petName}</h2>;
};

const renderDogs = (petName) => {
  return <h3>Dog: ${petName}</h3>;
};
```

One option is to write JSX like so

```jsx
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.description !== 'fluffy' && !(props.likes.includes('walks')) ? this.renderBirds(props.petName) : ''}
      {props.description === 'fluffy' && !(props.likes.includes('walks')) ? this.renderCats(props.petName) : ''}
      {props.description === 'fluffy' && props.likes.includes('walks') ? this.renderDogs(props.petName) : ''}
    </div>
  );
}
```
This is not very dry, a bit verbose, and doesn't scale very well if you need to add more predicates later on. 


## A solution using functional javascript

We can pull out the repeated parts, the predicates, into their own functions as follows

```jsx
const isFluffy = ({ description }) => description === 'fluffy';
const isNotFluffy = ({ description }) => !isFluffy({ description });
const likesWalks = ({ likes }) => likes.includes('walks');
const doesNotLikeWalks = ({ likes }) => !likesWalks({ likes });

```

Now we just need a map of what render functions we want to run based on the predicates

```jsx
const petRendering = [
  {
    renderFunction: renderBirds,
    predicates: [isNotFluffy, doesNotLikeWalks]
  },
  {
    renderFunction: renderCats,
    predicates: [isFluffy, doesNotLikeWalks]
  },
  {
    renderFunction: renderDogs,
    predicates: [isFluffy, doesLikeWalks]
  }
];
```

We can leverage reduce() to check each predicate against the state, to determine if all predicates are true.
This will be used to make our reducer function, which will evaluate to false if any of the predicates in the array are false, since false && any number of true is false.
The function also needs to curry the props into the scope of the function so it can run the predicate against the props.

```jsx
const predicateReducerHigherOrder = props => (result, predicate) => predicate(props) && result;
```

In the render function, we just pass the props to the curried function, then find the first result where all the predicates evaluate to true.
```jsx
const predicateReducer = predicateReducerHigherOrder(props);
const result = petRendering.find(petEntry => petEntry.predicates.reduce(predicateReducer, true));
return result ? result.renderFunction(props.petName) : '';
```
For each entry in the pet rendering array, we get the predicates list for the pet type, and then use reduce() to see if they all are true.
I really love this pattern even though it seems more verbose initially. I find it works exceptionally well when you need to check several aspects of state, but not enough to substantiate using an entire rules engine.
