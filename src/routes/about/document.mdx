# About Me

I am focused on advancing my JavaScript understanding and learning more about design patterns of full stack applications with ReactJS and GraphQL.
I also love any opportunity to show children from underrepresented communities how fun it is to code. This blog was created from James K Nelson's <a href="https://github.com/frontarm/create-react-blog">create-react-blog</a>.
